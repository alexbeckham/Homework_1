## The Beginning
---
Carta was founded by Henry Ward and Manu Kumar. Manu was a rabid investor who got the idea for electronic stock certificates because he was tired of dealing with paper ones. He saw Henry speaking (about another company) at a pitching event, heckled him while we was on stage and was impressed with  Henry's reaction, and eventually after investing in the company Henry was pitching at the time (which turned out to be a bust), got him on board with his idea for Carta. In 2012, they incorporated their company under the name Eshares. They rebranded to Carta in 2017. 

### Funding

At first it was hard to gain traction with venture capital firms. After being turned away from West coast firms, Henry headed to the East Coast to try and create some interest. By 2014, Carta was facing tough times. Union Square Ventures, a respected VC firm, finally invested and gained Carta some legitimacy. In early 2015,  Henry wrote a blog post called "Broken Cap Tables", essentially describing the need for Carta's product in plain, simple words. Fred Wilson, a well known venture capitalist, reblogged the post, which led to an outburst of support and company signups in early 2015. Venture Capitalists were begging to invest. 

Carta has now raised around $627.8M from 59 investors. Main investors are Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed, Spark Capital, K9 Ventures, and Tribe Capital. In a round of funding in May, Carta was valued at $3.1B. 

## Business Activities:
---
As most people know, stocks for public companies are traded on a public exchanges, such as the NASDAQ or NYSE, which are regulated by the SEC. Information about public companies and thier stock is very transparent and can be easily accessed with something as quick as a Google search. Public stock markets are also very liquid. 

Alternatively, stocks and options issued by private companies are not transparent at all. Starts ups trust law firms to handle their ownership. The information about stocks- how many shares outstanding, option grants, stock certificate, transfers, debt issuances, etc.- is extracted from legal documents prepared by the lawyers, and stored on an excel sheet called a capitalization table. Henry Ward described the problem with cap tables best in his 2015 blog post (mentioned earlier): "It is funny that mathematical expressions like vesting schedules, liquidation preferences, conversion ratios, and acceleration provisions are defined in prose." The updates that occur outside of the excel sheet, in the lawyer's offices, rarely make it to the excel sheet. 


Enter Carta. Carta's inital mission was to provide a digital platform for tracking capital tables (shares, ownership, value, dilution and options) for private companies, their investors, and employees. Basically replacing the paper stock certificates with electronic ones. Along with doing away with manual data entry and things like printing documents for siganture, Carta provides transparency and liquidity to ownership, 


Public markets are hyper liquid, private markets have zero liquidity, with nothing in between. In today's tech landscape, it is almost a given that employees receive stock options when they work at tech startups. 



* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Recommendations
---

Carta started as a service provider of cap table management and if it continues on it's current path, will end up as a central utility for fintech industry companies. We can see this with it's large offering of products beyond cap table management. These are the sevices currently offered on it's website:

* 409a valuations- A 409a valuation is an independent appraisal of common stock that is required by the IRS if a company wishes to issue common stock to its employees. It normally costs $5,000-$7,000 per valuation, and you have to get one every year (required by IRS) or every time you go through a round of funding. This product was offered through a SaaS pricing model.
* Scenario Modeling & Planning
* ASC 718 Reporting- This is reporting on the standards way companies expense employee stock-based compensation on the income statement. This is necessary for audits that happen as start ups start to raise more money and grow. 
* Private company liquidity events- with the goal for companies to offer liquidity every 12-18 months to its employees
* Carta for LLCs is new
* Carta for healthcare and life sciences- unique regulatory and compliance needs. 
* Investor Services is another product offered.

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Carta is already steadily moving in the direction that they should in order to outshine competition in the arena. They have expanded their product range from simply helping companies to organize and track the equity componenet of their financial statements, to providing services that directly impact valuation of these companies. The company now plays a major role in what goes into the cap tables that they track. 

Private markets have zero liquidity. 
Angel and seed investors tie up their money for years before they get it back. When the alternative to private market investing is public market investing, where money can be invested and returned within seconds, the number of investors who willingly lockup capital for years in early stage startups is small. 

The median age of technology companies going public has grown to over 12 years (2017-2019 average) compared to 4 years in 1999. This is causing investors to find alternative liquidity options. 

That’s why they are called angel investors. Only an angel would do it.
A more efficient capital market would be one with shorter duration. Imagine seed investors who could invest in the earliest stages of a pre-revenue startup, and then after the company finds product-market-fit and starts scaling, they can sell their stake to growth investors, and recycle that cash back into early stage pre-revenue companies. They would only have to hold positions for 2-3 years instead of 10. 

That would reduce the duration risk for seed investors, increase the supply of capital (I would do more angel investing if I didn’t have to hold for ten years), and reduce the cost of capital for entrepreneurs.
Late stage private companies lose talent to public companies
Late stage startups are in a talent trap. They are no longer recruiting risk-taking employees who want to join an early startup for its potential. Instead they are competing with public companies. For employees choosing between a public company or a private one, the late stage private company is the worst of both worlds. They no longer have the growth potential of early stage private companies, but they don’t have the liquidity of public companies either.
If private companies could offer cash, stock, and liquidity, they would win the talent wars with public companies because they could offer the best of both worlds — private company growth curves with public-like liquidity.

Market players leverage data sources such as PitchBook and Crunchbase to obtain information on the most recent primary round for a given company, but the most accurate information comes directly from companies. However, unlike public markets, private companies can use their discretion to determine what information they share and with whom. This provides certain players an informational advantage which tilts the playing field. Sometimes the biggest informational gap occurs between rounds when only people with access to the management team can get timely updates.

Also, unlike public markets, there is no “tape” to see a history of all the prices and volumes companies have traded at over a time series. Making matters more complex, blocks of shares from different rounds often have different liquidation preferences, causing shares from a given company to sometimes trade at different valuations. Thus, there’s often not just one price for a given company. This may not matter if a company’s valuation continues growing, but any exit below a historical priced round could have wildly different outcomes for shareholders of the same company based on liquidation preferences between different classes of stock.

Carta's newest venture is CartaX, its own private stock market. This is the natural progression for Carta. 

Employees who work at start ups often take salary cuts in exchange for stock in these companies. Eventually as a start up ages over time, tension grows for employees. In turn, private secondary markets have been created. 

CartaX will ultimately compete with public exchanges. 

the issuer is our customer and we build a market for that issuer’s stock with those issuer’s rules. It also means that all issuers will have to meet our listing requirements.

Companies that list on CartaX will be able to run periodic secondary transactions, allowing investors to bid in auctions for shares offered by employees and other stockholders. Carta will take a 1 per cent cut from both the buyers and sellers.

Competitors to CartaX are Manhattan Venture Partners, Nasdaq Private Market, and Zanbato.
