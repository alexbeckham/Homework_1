## The Beginning
---
Carta was founded by Henry Ward and Manu Kumar. Manu was a rabid investor who got the idea for electronic stock certificates because he was tired of dealing with paper ones. He saw Henry speaking (about another company) at a pitching event, heckled him while we was on stage and was impressed with  Henry's reaction, and eventually after investing in the company Henry was pitching at the time (which turned out to be a bust), got him on board with his idea for Carta. In 2012, they incorporated their company under the name Eshares. They rebranded to Carta in 2017. 

### Funding

At first it was hard to gain traction with venture capital firms. After being turned away from West coast firms, Henry headed to the East Coast to try and create some interest. By 2014, Carta was facing tough times. Union Square Ventures, a respected VC firm, finally invested and gained Carta some legitimacy. In early 2015,  Henry wrote a blog post called "Broken Cap Tables", essentially describing the need for Carta's product in plain, simple words. Fred Wilson, a well known venture capitalist, reblogged the post, which led to an outburst of support and company signups in early 2015. Venture Capitalists were begging to invest. 

Carta has now raised around $627.8M from 59 investors. Main investors are Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed, Spark Capital, K9 Ventures, and Tribe Capital. In a round of funding in May, Carta was valued at $3.1B. 

## Business Activities:
---
As most people know, stocks for public companies are traded on a public exchanges, such as the NASDAQ or NYSE, which are regulated by the SEC. Information about public companies and thier stock is very transparent and can be easily accessed with something as quick as a Google search. Public stock markets are also very liquid. 

Alternatively, stocks and options issued by private companies are not transparent at all. Starts ups trust law firms to handle their ownership. The information about stocks- how many shares outstanding, option grants, stock certificate, transfers, debt issuances, etc.- is extracted from legal documents prepared by the lawyers, and stored on an excel sheet called a capitalization table. Henry Ward described the problem with cap tables best in his 2015 blog post (mentioned earlier): "It is funny that mathematical expressions like vesting schedules, liquidation preferences, conversion ratios, and acceleration provisions are defined in prose." The updates that occur outside of the excel sheet, in the lawyer's offices, rarely make it to the excel sheet. 


Enter Carta. Carta's inital mission was to provide a digital platform for tracking capitalization tables (shares, ownership, value, dilution and options) for private companies, their investors, and employees. Basically replacing the paper stock certificates with electronic ones. Carta's platform provides transparency and liquidity to ownership by doing away with manual data entry and things like printing documents for siganture, digitalized cap tables, stock certificates, and corporate governance documents. The standardized from "lawyers to spreadsheets" product was definitely cleaner and helpful to companies, but it didn't have a humongous market and seemed pretty niche at first. 


Fast forward to 2020, and what started as a service provider of cap table management, now has the potential to end up as a central utility for fintech industry companies in which case the companies won't be able to function without it.  We can see how Carta has expanded it's original mission by looking at it's current product offerings:

* 409a valuations- A 409a valuation is an independent appraisal of common stock that is required by the IRS if a company wishes to issue common stock to its employees. It normally costs $5,000-$7,000 per valuation, and you have to get one every year (required by IRS) or every time you go through a round of funding. This product was offered through a SaaS pricing model.
* Scenario Modeling & Planning
* ASC 718 Reporting- This is reporting on the standard way companies expense employee stock-based compensation on the income statement. This is necessary for audits that happen as start ups start to raise more money and grow. 
* Private company liquidity events- with the goal for companies to offer liquidity every 12-18 months to its employees
* Carta for LLCs- the Carta package specialized for LLC's
* Carta for healthcare and life sciences- the Carta package specialized for healthcare companies' unique regulatory and compliance needs. 

The market for Carta is as big as how many private companies there are. The product provides value to small companies, big firms, start ups, late stage start ups, high growth start ups, you name it. Carta serves over 15,000 companies with over 800,000 investors. All of this data gathered on private companies and their value makes Carta's newest project, CartaX, seem like the obvious next step. 

It's a fact that angel and seed investors often have to wait many years to see any sort of return on their investments. The median age of technology companies going public has grown to over 12 years (2017-2019 average) compared to 4 years in 1999. This causes investors to find alternative liquidity options. The vision with CartaX is that seed investors could invest in the earliest stages of a pre-revenue startup, and then after the company finds product-market-fit and starts scaling, they can sell their stake to growth investors, and recycle that cash back into early stage pre-revenue companies. They would only have to hold positions for 2-3 years instead of 10. 

This time problem affects employees as well. The talent that comes to work for startup tech companies typically takes a salary cut in return for equity, but these days, incentives surrounding equity have become perverse, with employees beholden to a timeline so indeterminate that it begins to break the notion of incentive alignment that was originally achieved with widely owned equity.

The current secondary market landscape is extremely uneven and biased. The most accurate information comes directly from the companies themselves, however, unlike public markets, private companies can use their discretion to determine what information they share and with whom. Sometimes the biggest informational gap occurs between rounds when only people with access to the management team can get timely updates. Secondary markets also become extremely cloudy because there is no way to see a history of all of hte prices and volumes that companies have traded over time. Blocks of shares from different rounds often have different liquidation preferences, causing shares from a given company to sometimes trade at different valuations. Because of this, there many not be just one price for a given company. CartaX will be similar to the public exchanges in that the issuer is Carta's customer. Carta will build a market for the issuer's stock with the issuer's rules, but the issuer also has to meet CartaX's listing requirements. Companies that list on CartaX will be able to run periodic secondary transactions, allowing investors to bid in auctions for shares offered by employees and other stockholders. Carta will take a 1 per cent cut from both the buyers and sellers. With full knowledge of every single share, investor and all legal stipulations surrounding the equity and company, CartaX will be the first secondary platform to confer that trust through technology, and do so at scale.


## Landscape
---
In my opinion, Carta rules the equity management domain and is far more advanced than its competitors such as Shareworks by Morgan Stanley, Vestd, and EquityEffect. This is larely due in part to the fact that their subsequent product offerings (409a and investor services) worked in tandem with the digital cap table to give Carta the foothold it needed in the equity management space. When investors started requiring Carta be used for cap table management, Carta capitalized by then offering investor services, which then enabled funds to completed administer fund management through Carta. Cartaâ€™s fund administration business has become the fastest growing fund administration business in history.

Carta holds the ownership graph of 35% of all venture backed businesses. Framed as equity value, they have over $1 trillion USD in total equity value managed on their platform today.


## Recommendations
---

Carta is already steadily moving in the direction that they should in order to outshine competition in the arena. They have expanded their product range from simply helping companies to organize and track the equity componenet of their financial statements, to providing services that directly impact valuation of these companies. The company now plays a major role in what goes into the cap tables that they track. 

I would only recommend that Carta continue to service companies, even if their vision is to become public. Carta seems to take an aggressive view that private companies are better, and that private companies are the only ones they serve or that they want CartaX to overtake the public companies. Carta needs to make it clear that if a company wants to go public, it should. It needs to stay neutral and remember that all companies are different and have different goals. Many of their customers, who give them the data which allows them to even consider a project like CartaX, have the ultimate goal to become publicly traded companies, and that is okay.
